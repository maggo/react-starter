# React Starter

This is a react boilerplate based on `create-reactapp` containing:

* `redux`
* `react-router`
* `react-router-redux`
* `redux-thunk`

It also includes functionality to persist state to localstorage, but nothing is configured to do so. See [store/index.js](https://github.com/maggo/react-starter/blob/master/src/store/index.js#L26)
